# Changelog

## 2.0.0 (2026-11-06)

Breaking: rebuilt on the DominusNode Python SDK v2 and the relay network.

- Exposes exactly the 19 standard v2 tools (fetch, proxy_url, network policy/pricing/stats,
  wallet balance/transactions/crypto top-up/payment status, usage, sessions, nodes, node setup
  guide, credits, payouts, x402).
- Removed Stripe/PayPal top-ups, plans, slots, account/email/password/MFA tools, team and
  agentic-wallet admin tools, hardcoded prices and dc-/residential- pool prefixes.
- Removed the duplicated HTTP client and SSRF code; the SDK handles both.
- API key only from `DOMINUSNODE_API_KEY` or config; all outputs and errors are scrubbed.

## 1.0.1

- Fix branding: replace "DomiNode" with "Dominus Node" throughout

## 1.0.0 (2026-03-01)

- Initial release
- 4 CrewAI tools: proxy fetch, wallet balance, top-up (Stripe), top-up (PayPal)
- SSRF protection, credential scrubbing, OFAC compliance

## [2.2.0] - 2026-11-13

### Changed
- Proxy traffic now goes to the gateway's TLS (HTTPS proxy) listener on port 8443 by default, and `proxy_url` returns `https://...:8443`. Production gateways refuse credentials on plaintext 8080/1080, so `fetch` failed on first use before. `DOMINUSNODE_PROXY_URL=https://host[:port]` sets the gateway host and TLS port (same variable as the MCP server; self-hosted coordinators publish 8444), `DOMINUSNODE_PROXY_TLS_PORT` sets only the port, and `DOMINUSNODE_PROXY_INSECURE=1` selects plaintext for local development.
- The node setup guide uses the published node image (`ghcr.io/0xcircuitbreaker/dominusnode-node`), which has the official coordinator pins baked in. A plain source build has none and now refuses to start.
- Requires the DominusNode SDK 2.2.0 or later (relay error codes on refused CONNECTs).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-11-12

### Added
- The fetch tool's `ip_class` accepts `masked` (cheapest, VPN/anonymizer exits, opt-in; never used unless asked).

### Changed
- Requires the DominusNode SDK 2.1.0 or later (`masked` support).
